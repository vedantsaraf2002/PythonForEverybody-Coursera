# PythonForEverybody-Coursera

This repository contains all the graded code assignment solutions for the " PYTHON FOR EVERYBODY " course on Coursera by the University of Michigan under the instructor, Charles Russell Severance.

This repository is to take help if you get stuck in an assignment but please do try to solve the assignments on your own rather than simply copying the codes.

All the codes in this repository are written by me.

You can mail me on vedantsaraf2002@gmail.com for any doubts about the codes in this repository.

Thank you!

Regards,
Vedant Saraf
